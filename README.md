# Fake News Detection

Fake News Detection is a project that employs NetworkX, TensorFlow, and GossipCop to combat the spread of misinformation. It represents news articles as graph nodes and leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for comprehensive analysis, including text content, metadata, and source trustworthiness assessment. The project achieved an impressive 91% accuracy in identifying instances of fake news using the GNN-based analysis, contributing to the reduction of misinformation propagation.

## Features

- **Graph-based Representation**: News articles are represented as nodes in a graph, enabling GNN-based analysis.

- **Text and Metadata Analysis**: The project performs comprehensive analysis of text content and metadata to assess the credibility of news articles.

- **Source Trustworthiness**: The trustworthiness of news sources is considered, enhancing the accuracy of detection.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the Fake News Detection project on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```zsh
python (filename of gnn model)
```
